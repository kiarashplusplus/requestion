V0:
For /query to return at least one type of results (i.e. `news_article`) for any query.

TODO:
* use Bing News API in results.js
* react-native app to show results
* new overlay endpoint that uploads a sticker to cloudinary and returns a demo image with sticker overlay

V1:
* extend `template.js` with more types
* group similar sticker types together on app
* add support for multiple MuiTheme in /sticker endpoint
* add sticker page view on react native with sharing buttons and swatch icon for changing themes
